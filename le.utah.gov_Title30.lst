          30-3-34.5(4)(a): whether the cost of professional or agency services is likely to prevent the noncustodial parent from exercising parent-time; and
          30-3-34.5(4)(b): whether the requirement for supervised parent-time should expire after a set period of time.
      30-3-34.5(5): The court shall, in its order for supervised parent-time, provide specific goals and expectations for the noncustodial parent to accomplish before unsupervised parent-time may be granted.

      30-3-34.5(6): A noncustodial parent may, at any time, petition the court to modify the order for supervised parent-time if the noncustodial parent can demonstrate that the specific goals and expectations set by the court in Subsection 5[Ref: 30-3-34.5(5)]
